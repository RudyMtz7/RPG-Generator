You enter the exam room sweaty and uneasy.
You can feel your body shaking, althought you cannot see it.
This was probably a bad idea.
You are so nervous you did not realize the answers you bought
slipped from your bag as you sat down.
Bad luck, the teacher did notice. You can expect seing him
again at least for a semester.
Game Over.
