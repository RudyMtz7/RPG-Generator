You are in the parking lot.
To your left is the library.
To your right is the cafe, where your friends typically
gather up to play video games and hang around.
In front of you, lies the ATM machine.

It is well known about a guy who usually hangs at the back
of the parking lot selling exam answers. If anything,
it is an option.
